# Terraso Library Prototype

The Terraso Library Prototype is a Progressive Web App that allows the user to view "documents" (images, pdfs, text files, etc.) And gives them the opportunity to save these documents to be viewed offline. This prototype was created as part of the [1000 Landscapes Project](https://techmatters.org/project/1000-landscapes/) primarily to research the fucntionality and limitations of Progressive Web Apps. This prototype also relies on Amazon services such as AppSync, DynamoDB, and Amazon S3


## Installation 
This content prototype uses npm for package management and can be installed and ran with the following commands
```
npm i https://github.com/techmatters/terraso-library-prototype (currently not working? Ask Paul about security)
npm run start
```
