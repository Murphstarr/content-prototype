# Terraso Content Viewer PWA Prototype

This PWA prototype allows for the viewing of documents (images, pdfs, text files, etc.) as well as providing functionality to store those documents to be viewed offline. It was created as part of the [1000 Landscapes Project](https://techmatters.org/project/1000-landscapes/) primarily to research the limitations of Progressive Web Apps, especially concerning offline capabilities and storage. 



## Usage
This content prototype uses npm for package management and can be run with the following commands

```c
npm run build
serve -s build
```
